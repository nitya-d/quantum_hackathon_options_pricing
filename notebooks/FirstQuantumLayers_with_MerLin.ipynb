        "\n",
        "- Enable amplitude encoding when constructing the layer by passing `amplitude_encoding=True` to `QuantumLayer` (you must also provide `n_photons`).\n",
        "- The effective input size depends on the chosen `computation_space` (FOCK / UNBUNCHED / DUAL_RAIL) and the circuit -- inspect `layer.input_size` or `len(layer.state_keys)` to build correctly-sized amplitude vectors.\n",
        "- Inputs may be batched: pass a tensor of shape `(B, input_size)` to evaluate many amplitude states in one call; the layer will vectorise where possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "- When using amplitude encoding you cannot mix classical `input_parameters` with the amplitude tensor (the amplitude becomes the new input state).\n",
        "- If you require dual-rail encoding, ensure the circuit has the correct mode pairing (dual-rail expects pairs of modes per logical qubit)."

        "In this notebook we explored three practical ways to build and train photonic QuantumLayer modules:\n",

        "- QuantumLayer.simple: a compact, ready-to-train factory useful for fast prototyping and capacity comparisons.\n",
        "- CircuitBuilder: a declarative and repeatable API that separates encoding metadata from circuit structure and is the recommended path for training experiments.\n",
        "- Hand-crafted Perceval circuits & Experiment: full control over optical layout, detectors and noise models; use this when you need detector-level semantics or to evaluate realistic experiment conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key takeaways:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Choose your measurement strategy to match the downstream head (probabilities for dense heads, mode expectations to reduce parameters, amplitudes only for noiseless unitary simulations).\n",
        "- Grouping (LexGrouping / ModGrouping) is an effective way to collapse the combinatorial Fock outputs into a compact classical representation.\n",
        "- The computation space (FOCK / UNBUNCHED / DUAL_RAIL) controls the simulator's state basis and strongly impacts runtime and memory; prefer UNBUNCHED (no-bunching) when your circuits restrict photons to distinct modes.\n",
        "- Amplitude encoding requires the full computation-space vector; pad missing amplitudes with zeros and re-normalise before passing data to the layer.\n",
        "- When using experiments with detectors or noise, switch to sampling/probability outputs and consider shot noise when training or benchmarking.\n",
